  Why Plausible?
</h2>
<p>Here's what makes Plausible a great Google Analytics alternative and why we're trusted by thousands of paying subscribers to deliver their website and business insights:</p><ul><li><strong>Clutter Free</strong>: Plausible Analytics provides <a href="https://plausible.io/simple-web-analytics">simple web analytics</a> and it cuts through the noise. No layers of menus, no need for custom reports. Get all the important insights on one single page. No training necessary.</li><li><strong>GDPR/CCPA/PECR compliant</strong>: Measure traffic, not individuals. No personal data or IP addresses are ever stored in our database. We don't use cookies or any other persistent identifiers. <a href="https://plausible.io/data-policy">Read more about our data policy</a></li><li><strong>Lightweight</strong>: Plausible Analytics works by loading a script on your website, like Google Analytics. Our script is <a href="https://plausible.io/lightweight-web-analytics">45x smaller</a>, making your website quicker to load.</li><li><strong>Email or Slack reports</strong>: Keep an eye on your traffic with weekly and/or monthly email or Slack reports. You can also get traffic spike notifications.</li><li><strong>Open website stats</strong>: You have the option to be transparent and open your web analytics to everyone. Your website stats are private by default but you can choose to make them public so anyone with your custom link can view them.</li><li><strong>Define key goals and track conversions</strong>: Set custom events or page URLs as your goals and see how they convert over time to understand and identify the trends that matter. Includes easy ways to track outbound link clicks and 404 error pages.</li><li><strong>Search keywords</strong>: Integrate your dashboard with Google Search Console to get the most accurate reporting on your search keywords.</li><li><strong>SPA support</strong>: Plausible is built with modern web frameworks in mind and it works automatically with any pushState based router on the frontend. We also support frameworks that use the URL hash for routing. See <a href="https://plausible.io/docs/hash-based-routing">our documentation</a>.</li></ul><p>Interested to learn more? <a href="https://plausible.io">Read more on our website</a>, learn more about the team and the goals of the project on <a href="https://plausible.io/about">our about page</a> or explore <a href="https://plausible.io/docs">the documentation</a>.</p><h2 id="why-is-plausible-analytics-cloud-not-free-like-google-analytics" class="section-heading">

  Why is Plausible Analytics Cloud not free like Google Analytics?
</h2>
<p>Plausible Analytics is an independently owned and actively developed project. To keep the project development going, to stay in business, to continue putting effort into building a better product and to cover our costs, we need to charge a fee.</p><p>Google Analytics is free because Google has built their company and their wealth by collecting and analyzing huge amounts of personal information from web users and using these personal and behavioral insights to sell advertisements.</p><p>Plausible has no part in that business model. No personal data is being collected and analyzed either. With Plausible, you 100% own and control all of your website data. This data is not being shared with or sold to any third-parties.</p><p>We choose the subscription business model rather than the business model of surveillance capitalism. See reasons why we believe you should <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/remove-google-analytics">stop using Google Analytics on your website</a>.</p><h2 id="getting-started-with-plausible" class="section-heading">

  Getting started with Plausible
</h2>
<p>The easiest way to get started with Plausible is with <a href="https://plausible.io/#pricing">our official managed service in the cloud</a>. It takes 2 minutes to start counting your stats with a worldwide CDN, high availability, backups, security and maintenance all done for you by us.</p><p>In order to be compliant with the GDPR and the Schrems II ruling, all visitor data for our managed service in the cloud is exclusively processed on servers and cloud infrastructure owned and operated by European providers. Your website data never leaves the EU.</p><p>Our managed hosting can save a substantial amount of developer time and resources. For most sites this ends up being the best value option and the revenue goes to funding the maintenance and further development of Plausible. So you’ll be supporting open source software and getting a great service!</p><h3 id="can-plausible-analytics-be-self-hosted" class="section-heading">

  </a>
  Can Plausible Analytics be self-hosted?
</h3>
<p>Plausible is fully <a href="https://plausible.io/open-source-website-analytics">open source web analytics</a> and we have a free as in beer <a href="https://plausible.io/self-hosted-web-analytics">Plausible Analytics Self-Hosted</a> solution. It’s exactly the same product as our cloud solution with a less frequent release schedule (think of it as a long term support release).</p><p>Bug fixes and new features are released to the cloud version several times per week. Features are battle-tested in the cloud which allows us to fix any bugs before the general self-hosted release. Every six months or so we combine all the changes into a new self-hosted release.</p><p>The main difference between the two is that the self-hosted version you have to install, host and manage yourself on your own infrastructure while the cloud version we manage everything for your ease and convenience. Here's the overview of all the differences:</p><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left;"></th><th style="text-align: left;">Plausible Cloud</th><th style="text-align: left;">Self-Hosting</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: left;">Hosting</td><td style="text-align: left;">Easy and convenient. It takes 2 minutes to start counting your stats with a worldwide CDN, high availability, backups, security and maintenance all done for you by us. We manage everything so you don’t have to worry about anything and can focus on your stats.</td><td style="text-align: left;">You do it all yourself. You need to get a server and you need to manage your infrastructure. You are responsible for installation, maintenance, upgrades, server capacity, uptime, backup, security, stability, consistency, loading time and so on.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left;">Storage</td><td style="text-align: left;">All visitor data is exclusively processed on EU-owned cloud infrastructure. We keep your site data on a secure, encrypted and green energy powered server in Germany. This ensures that your site data is protected by the strict European Union data privacy laws and ensures compliance with GDPR. Your website data never leaves the EU.</td><td style="text-align: left;">You have full control and can host your instance on any server in any country that you wish. Host it on a server in your basement or host it with any cloud provider wherever you want, even those that are not GDPR compliant.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left;">Releases</td><td style="text-align: left;">Continuously developed and improved with new features and updates multiple times per week.</td><td style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://plausible.io/blog/building-open-source">It's a long term release</a> published approximately twice per year so latest features won't be immediately available. You can see all the <a href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">currently unreleased features in the changelog</a>.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left;">Raw data</td><td style="text-align: left;">You see all your site stats and metrics on our modern-looking, simple to use and fast loading dashboard. You can only see the stats aggregated in the dashboard. You can download the stats using the <a href="https://plausible.io/docs/export-stats">CSV export</a>, <a href="https://plausible.io/docs/stats-api">stats API</a> or tools such as the <a href="https://plausible.io/docs/integration-guides#google-data-studio">Data Studio Connector</a>.</td><td style="text-align: left;">Do you want access to the raw data? Self-hosting gives you that option. You can take the data directly from the ClickHouse database.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left;">Premium Support</td><td style="text-align: left;">Real support delivered by real human beings who build and maintain Plausible.</td><td style="text-align: left;">Premium support is not included. Self-hosting is community supported only.</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left;">Costs</td><td style="text-align: left;">There's a cost associated with providing an analytics service so we charge a subscription fee. We choose the subscription business model rather than the business model of surveillance capitalism. Your money funds further development of Plausible.</td><td style="text-align: left;">You need to pay for your server, CDN, backups and whatever other cost there is associated with running the infrastructure. You never have to pay any fees to us. Your money goes to 3rd party companies with no connection to us.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Interested in self-hosting Plausible on your server? Take a look at our <a href="https://plausible.io/docs/self-hosting">self-hosting installation instructions</a>.</p><p>Plausible Self-Hosted is a community supported project and there are no guarantees that you will get support from the creators of Plausible to troubleshoot your self-hosting issues. There is a <a href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics/discussions/categories/self-hosted-support">community supported forum</a> where you can ask for help.</p><p>Our only source of funding is our premium, managed service for running Plausible in the cloud.
